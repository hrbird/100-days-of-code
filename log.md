# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Week 1
**Link to work:** [Week 01](https://github.com/hrbird/100-days-of-code/tree/master/week01)

### Day 1: January 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Started with a Hello World program, of course.  
- Set up VSCode and Github for this 100-day project.
- Began refreshing knowledge of Python fundamentals by looking at tutorials and playing around with the editor.
- Signed up for "100 Days of Python" Udemy class for learning and inspiration. Completed days 1-3.
- Made a few quick programs:
  - **helloworld.py**: Basic "hello world" program, with some ASCII art.
  - **basicmath.py**: Asks the user for two numbers, then performs simple math operations with those numbers.
  - **weightconversion.py**: Asks the user for their weight in pounds, then converts it to kg, stones, and a variety of silly measurements.
  - **tipcalculator.py**: Asks the user for a bill total and how many people will split the bill. Calculates and displays a table with common tip amounts and how much each person should pay.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I've used Python, and Python 3 syntax has changed in a few ways since Python 2, so I decided to start from the beginning with some very simple projects. I feel excited and determined.

### Day 2: January 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued working through "100 Days of Python" Udemy class. Completed days 4-7.
- Focused on validating input, randomization, loops, and functions.
- More quick programs:
  - **numberguesser.py**: A game that asks the player to guess a secret random number between 1 and 1000 within 10 guesses. Incorporates a basic game loop and input validation.
  - **rockpaperscissors.py**: A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The player enters their choice while the computer picks a random choice. Then the program shows ASCII art of each choice and determines the winner.
  - **fizzbuzz.py**: A classic interview challenge. Print out each integer from 1 to 100, unless it's divisible by 3, 5, or 15. In those cases, write special keywords instead.
  - **passwordgen.py**: Generates a random, secure password with a given number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
  - **hangman.py**: A classic game in which the computer chooses a random word, and the player guesses which letters are in it. If they guess all the letters in the word without too many mistakes, they win. If they make too many wrong guesses, they hang.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty comfortable with playing around with lists, loops, and basic functions.

### Day 3: January 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- Continued working through "100 Days of Python" Udemy class. Completed days 8-11.
- Focused on function parameters (positional and keyword), dictionaries, nesting lists and dictionaries, docstrings, and dipping a little into classes/OOP.
- More quick programs:
  - **primenumber.py**: Checks whether or not a given number is a prime number.
  - **caesarcipher.py**: Uses the Caesar Cipher mode of encryption to encode or decode secret messages.
  - **calculator.py**: Acts as a calculator that can perform basic math operations for the user.
  - **blackjack.py**: A standard game of blackjack. Creates a shuffled deck of 52 cards, keeps track of the player and dealer's hands, calculates hand values, handles the dealer's decisions, and determines the winner/outcome.

**Thoughts:** I continued working on exercises from the "100 Days of Python" class and adding a little more complexity to them. The Blackjack project was supposed to be a lot simpler (just pulling random values from a list of possible card values, with no classes). However, I felt confident to try including classes and more complicated game logic (creating a full deck of 52 cards, using logic to determine when aces should be counted as 1 vs 11, and creating classes with initializers for the Cards, Deck, and Hands). Having fun pushing myself :)

### Day 4: January 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
- I started this 100-days project on Jan 12 in a fork of the repository made by the original creator of this challenge. However, I have just learned that GitHub does not count commits in forked repositories as contributions in your user profile. Therefore, I am copying my work from the first 3 days into a new, standalone repository!
- Continued working through "100 Days of Python" Udemy class. Completed days 12-.
- Focused on scope, object-oriented programming, the turtle graphics library, 
- More quick programs:
  - **learn_turtle.py**: Simple program that creates a green turtle and has it create an original modern art piece by walking in a random direction for a random number of steps.
